# Titanic Random Forest Model

This repository contains code and files related to my project to create a machine learning model to predict survival rates on the titanic. The project is based on using the random forest algorithm from the scikit-learn library. Each line of code is signed with a comment.

### Project description

### Project goal
The goal of the project is to create a model capable of predicting whether a passenger on the titanic will survive based on various attributes such as ticket class, age, gender, and others.

### Technologies used
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to use

**Data Analysis**: Examine Jupyter Notebook `RandomForestClassifier.ipynb` to understand how the data analysis and preprocessing was done. There is a commentary for each line of code.
